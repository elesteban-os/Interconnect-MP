# Interconnect Simulation for Multiprocessor Systems

**Course**: CE-4302 Computer Architecture II
**Institution**: Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica
**Students**: Esteban Chinchilla Rodriguez, Albert Vega Camacho, Abraham Venegas Mayorga
**Semester**: I-2025

## üìå Project Overview

This project main objective is to apply the concepts of computer architecture II to the design and implementation of a simulation model of an interconnect as part of a multiprocessor (MP) system, in order to perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of performance under different arbitration/communication schemes.

## üß© System Features

* Implemented in **C++** using **multithreading** capabilities (C++20).
* Developed and compiled using **g++ 13.3.0** on **Linux (Ubuntu)**.
* Interface created using **Qt Creator**.
* Graphics were made with plotly in **Python**.
* Includes support for two arbitration schemes:

  * FIFO (ignores QoS).
  * QoS-based priority.

* Simulation of message transfer times and memory access delays.
* Step-by-step (stepping) simulation support.
* Final report includes statistics for bandwidth, traffic, and amount of messages of each PE.

## üß± Project Structure

Each processing element simulates a private instruction memory and cache and communicates with a shared memory via the Interconnect using the following message types:

* `WRITE_MEM`
* `READ_MEM`
* `BROADCAST_INVALIDATE`
* `INV_ACK`
* `INV_COMPLETE`
* `READ_RESP`
* `WRITE_RESP`

## üìÇ Dependencies and Includes

The following standard headers are used in the project:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>
#include <variant>
#include <array>
```

## üß™ Workloads

Two distinct workloads were developed to test each arbitration scheme. Each workload uses all 8 PEs, with each executing at least 10 instructions.

## üìä Output and Visualization

After each workload execution, the system generates:

* Bandwidth graphs.
* Traffic charts.
* Amount of messages of each PE



## Requirements:

* Ubuntu Linux OS
* Qt Creator (recommended for building the interface)
* g++ 13.3.0 or compatible compiler
* Python 3.8.10

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation Instructions

En la terminal corra los siguientes comandos antes de iniciar.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

Make sure that you have instaled the g++ compiler.

```bash
g++ --version
```

If not, execute this command to install it.

```bash
sudo apt install g++
```

Make sure that you have installed python.

```bash
python3 --version
```

To install qtcreator run the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt install qtcreator qtbase5-dev
```
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential¬†cmake
```
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5
```


Install the library for the graphic with the following commands (if you already have the pip package, don't execute the first command).
```bash
sudo apt install python python3-pip
```
```bash
pip install plotly
```

Right click on the executable file called main, then click on properties and click on the permissions tab, and check on "Allow executable file as program". Then type the following commands on the terminal.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
```

```bash
sudo apt update
```


```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```


```bash
sudo apt install gcc-13 g++-13
```


In the terminal on the main.py file:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 main.py
```
